# Python Projects
**A)Python_PRJ_1** -  The project implements the Basics of Python like data structures and functions.


**B)Python Web Scraping Project** - In this project, I scraped data from Wikipedia using BeautifulSoup and converted it to a Pandas DataFrame. It is the list of largest companies in the United States by Revenue as of 2023. The data is then stored in Companies.CSV format for reference. I have uploaded the Companies.CSV file.
